Exploratory Data Analysis

Question 1:
```{r}
?mpg
hist(mpg$hwy)
```
I see that the most common highway miles per gallon are between 15 and 30, with the lowest between 35 and 45.

Question 2:
```{r}
x <- mpg$hwy
y <- mpg$cty
plot(x,y)
```
The relationship appears to be that when highway miles per gallon increases, city miles per gallon also increases.
